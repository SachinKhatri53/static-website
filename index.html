                        This WPF project is a feature-rich application that leverages the power of ListView and GridView
                        controls to enable efficient CRUD operations. The application's data source is dynamically
                        populated from the code-behind, ensuring real-time updates and interactions with the user
                        interface. Users can seamlessly create, read, update, and delete data entries, all displayed in
                        a user-friendly tabular format, thanks to the intuitive design of the GridView.

                        implemented through a carefully designed form. Whether it's organizing elements horizontally,
                        vertically, or in a grid-based structure, this project provides a hands-on demonstration of
                        WPF's layout capabilities. Similarly different types of WPF controls such as button, label,
                        combo box,
                        border, textbox, checkbox have been implemented.

                        by the Code-Behind. The project serves as a practical example of how WPF's XAML and Code-Behind
                        work harmoniously to create functional and intuitive applications.
