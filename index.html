                    In a WPF program, different modes of data binding are employed to establish connections between
                    the UI elements and the underlying data source. One such mode is "OneWay," where changes in the
                    data source update the UI elements but not vice versa. Another mode is "TwoWay," enabling
                    bidirectional synchronization between the UI and data source, allowing changes in either to
                    reflect in the other. String formatting is utilized to control the presentation of data in the UI,
                    ensuring that it is
                    displayed in a specific format. This can involve formatting numbers with decimal places, adding
                    currency symbols, or specifying date and time formats. String formatting enhances the user
                    experience by making data more readable and understandable in the application's UI.

                        easily. The program features a map control integrated with a marker feature, enabling users to
                        display custom markers on the map to represent different locations or points of interest. Users
                        can interact with these markers for additional information or actions. Additionally, a combo box
                        is provided to allow users to change locations dynamically, updating the map and marker display

                        specific pages or external content. The use of a tab control organizes content into multiple
                        tabs, facilitating efficient switching between different views or sections of the application.
                        Additionally, window navigation allows users to open new windows or dialog boxes for specific
                        tasks, maintaining the flow of the application while providing focused interactions.
